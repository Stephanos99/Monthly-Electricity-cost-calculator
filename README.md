# Monthly-Electricity-cost-calculator

The user is asked to input an appliance (ex. fridge, kettle...) and then give its consumption (kw) and how many hours they plan to use it per day.
The programm loops these 3 inputs until the user types 'done'.
It then outputs a table with the name of each appliance, the daily consumption (hours per day * consumption) and the monthly cost (€).
The cost is calculated with 0.33 €/kwh.
At the end of the table, the total cost of all the appliances together is calculated
